#Track User Logins
Write a bash script which will fulfill the below requirements:
- Create new directory if not exists /root/Users_Login_Data/ from within the script.
- Capture the current logged in users data [ Username , Login Date and Time , IP Address of User Machine ] only in a file under the /root/Users_Login_Data/ directory.
- The Script must be triggered every minute from Crontab and new file must be created every minute under the  /root/Users_Login_Data/ directory, Keep your file names as Users_Month-Date-Year-Hour-Minute.txt. So the script will keep on generating txt files under /root/Users_Login_Data/ directory every minute.



#!/bin/bash


#Create new directory if not exsists

mkdir -p /root/Users_Login_Data/


#Get Date in a variable

DATE=`date +'%m-%d-%Y-%H-%M'`


#Log the Users Data in a file

who | awk '{print $1,$3,$4,$5}' > /root/Users_Login_Data/Users_$DATE.txt
