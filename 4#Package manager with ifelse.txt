#Package manager with if/else
Write a bash script which will fulfill the below requirements:

- Create a script which will ask the user to type a method that user want to use: search or install or remove

- Then script will ask the user to provide Linux package name as an input that user want to search/install or remove.

- If user has selected the search, then script will search for the given package and print back the results to the user on screen.

- If user has selected the install, then script will search for the given package and install the package for the user.

- If user has selected the search, then script will search for the given package and remove the package from local system.

- You have to create 3 different functions for search, install and remove.

- You have to use If/Else conditions to verify which function needs to be used as per user input.
