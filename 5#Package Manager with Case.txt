- Then script will ask the user to provide Linux package name as an input that user want to search/install/remove.

- If user has selected the search, then script will search for the given package and print back the results to the user on screen.

- If user has selected the install, then script will search for the given package and install the package for the user.

- If user has selected the search, then script will search for the given package and remove the package from local system.
