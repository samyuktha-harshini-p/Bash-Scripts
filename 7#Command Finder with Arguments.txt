#Command Finder with Arguments

Write a bash script which will fulfill the below requirements:

- Create a script which will read the arguments passed to the script while running it.

- Script will take single argument only which will be command name [like sed, awk etc.]

- If no. of arguments are more or less than 1 than script will exit with error. Else Script will search on local system if system has that command available or not, and then using If else you need to notify the user about the availability of the command.


#!/bin/bash

    echo "Invalid number of parameters"

    exit 1
